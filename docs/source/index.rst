Welcome to the Crop forecasting project !
=========================================

Overview
--------

Welcome to our Climate Change and Crop Yield Prediction project! We are a team of two junior Data Scientists, Baptiste Urgell and Louis Reberga, recently graduated from `CY-Tech <https://cytech.cyu.fr/>`_ and currently working at `Aqsone <https://www.aqsone.com/>`_. In this project, we aim to build models that will help scientists better understand the impact of climate change on crop yields, with a focus on rice cultivation.

Challenge Description
---------------------

Climate change, along with man-made conflicts and economic downturns, is one of the main causes of acute hunger. By leveraging data from Microsoft's Planetary Computer, including Sentinel-1 (radar), Sentinel-2 (optical), and Landsat (optical) satellite data, we will develop predictive models to forecast crop yields in areas of rice cultivation. Our goal is to contribute to the scientific community's understanding of the effects of climate change on crop production and support efforts to mitigate its impact on food security.

About Us
--------

- Baptiste Urgell: I am a Data Scientist with a background in statistics and machine learning. I have a strong interest in applying data-driven solutions to real-world challenges, particularly in the field of environmental sustainability. I am excited to contribute to this project and apply my skills to better understand the impacts of climate change on crop yields.

- Louis Reberga: I am a Data Scientist with a passion for leveraging data and analytics to generate insights and solve complex problems. My expertise lies in machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis. I am eager to work on this project and contribute to the development of models that can provide valuable insights into the effects of climate change on rice cultivation.

Project Goals
-------------

Our main objectives for this project are:

- Build predictive models using machine/deep learning techniques to forecast crop yields for rice cultivation areas.

- Utilize satellite data from Microsoft's Planetary Computer (Sentinel-2), Meteorological data and Paddies informations from EY, to train and validate our models.

- Analyze the impact of climate change on crop yields and provide insights to the scientific community to support efforts in addressing food security challenges.

Conclusion
----------

We are excited to embark on this project and contribute to the understanding of the impacts of climate change on crop yields. By leveraging our skills in data science and machine/deep learning, along with the rich dataset provided by Microsoft's Planetary Computer, we aim to develop models that can provide valuable insights for scientists and stakeholders working on addressing the challenges of climate change and food security.
